  - `references/` - Reference documentation for framework concepts

**.planning/ - Project State (Currently Empty):**
- Purpose: Persistent storage of project roadmap, phases, and execution history
- Contains:
  - `ROADMAP.md` (created by new-project) - High-level phase descriptions
  - `STATE.md` (created by new-project) - Current project state and metrics
  - `MILESTONES.md` (created when completing milestones) - Archive of completed milestones
  - Phase directories: `1.0/`, `1.1/`, `2.0/`, etc.
- Key files: None yet (create when starting project)

**.planning/codebase/ - Codebase Analysis (Generated):**
- Purpose: Store analysis documents generated by /gsd:map-codebase
- Contains: ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, CONCERNS.md
- Key files:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and layer design
  - `STRUCTURE.md` - File organization and naming conventions
  - `CONVENTIONS.md` - Coding standards and patterns (when application code exists)
  - `TESTING.md` - Testing frameworks and patterns (when application code exists)

**.planning/1.0/ - Phase Directory (Template):**
- Purpose: Store all deliverables and documentation for a phase
- Contains:
  - `PLAN.md` - Implementation plan with tasks and waves
  - `CONTEXT.md` - Requirements and constraints from user
  - `SUMMARY.md` - Post-execution report (created after execution)
  - Application code files generated during execution

## Key File Locations

**Entry Points:**
- `/gsd:*` commands are the primary entry points (parsed by Claude interface)
- Commands reference `.claude/commands/gsd/*.md` files
- No traditional main.js or entry point file (orchestrator handles command dispatching)

**Configuration:**
- `.claude/settings.json` - GSD framework configuration
- `.claude/gsd-file-manifest.json` - Manifest of all framework files
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Project state and metadata (created by new-project)
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Phase descriptions and roadmap (created by new-project)

**Core Logic:**
- `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js` - All state operations, phase management, validation
- `.claude/agents/gsd-planner.md` - Phase planning logic
- `.claude/agents/gsd-executor.md` - Code execution and generation logic

**Testing:**
- `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.test.js` - Test suite for gsd-tools.js
- No application test files yet (created when phases execute)

## Naming Conventions

**Files:**
- Markdown files: UPPERCASE.md (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md)
- Agent files: gsd-{role}.md (gsd-executor.md, gsd-planner.md, gsd-verifier.md)
- Command files: {action}.md (execute-phase.md, map-codebase.md, plan-phase.md)
- Executable scripts: lowercase-hyphenated.js (gsd-tools.js)
- Configuration: {tool}.json (settings.json, gsd-file-manifest.json)

**Directories:**
- GSD framework: kebab-case (get-shit-done, codebase-mapper)
- Phase directories: decimal format (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1)
- Type-specific directories: plural lowercase (agents, commands, workflows, templates, references)
- Hidden directories: .prefixed (.claude, .planning, .git)

## Where to Add New Code

**New Application Feature:**
- Primary code: `[phase-directory]/[feature-files]` (e.g., `.planning/1.0/src/services/user.ts`)
- Tests: `[feature-directory].test.ts` or `tests/` subdirectory within phase
- Following STRUCTURE.md and CONVENTIONS.md from codebase analysis

**New GSD Phase:**
- Phase directory: `.planning/{decimal}/` (use `gsd-tools.js phase add` command)
- Phase plan: `.planning/{decimal}/PLAN.md` (generated by planner agent)
- Phase context: `.planning/{decimal}/CONTEXT.md` (from user requirements)
- Application artifacts: `[feature-path]/` as specified in PLAN.md

**New GSD Workflow:**
- Definition: `.claude/commands/gsd/{action}.md` (if user-facing command)
- Supporting workflow: `.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/{action}.md` (implementation steps)
- Reference agent: `.claude/agents/gsd-{role}.md` (existing or new role)

**Utilities or Helpers:**
- Shared framework utilities: `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/` (Node.js scripts)
- Shared templates: `.claude/get-shit-done/templates/` (pre-filled markdown)
- Reference docs: `.claude/get-shit-done/references/` (markdown guides)

## Special Directories

**.claude/ - GSD Framework:**
- Purpose: Contains framework infrastructure; do not commit application code here
- Generated: No, committed as part of framework
- Committed: Yes, all files are tracked in git

**.planning/ - Project State:**
- Purpose: Project roadmap, phases, and execution history
- Generated: Yes (created by new-project, updated by phase commands)
- Committed: Yes, all planning docs are tracked in git

**.git/ - Repository Metadata:**
- Purpose: Git version control
- Generated: Yes, created by git init
- Committed: Not applicable (git internal)

**Application Directories (None Yet):**
- When phases execute, new directories will be created (src/, tests/, config/, etc.)
- These should follow the structure defined in STRUCTURE.md from codebase analysis
- Location depends on application type (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.)
